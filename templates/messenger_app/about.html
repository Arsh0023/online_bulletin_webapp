        <p style="font-size:20px;">Hi everyone my name is ARSHPREET SINGH i made this as my summer training project with BHASKAR SIR as my mentor,thanks a lot sir for helping me with this !</p>

<p><u><b>MY MOTIVATION TO DEVELOP THIS:- </b></u></p>

<p> We all know everyone&rsquo;s going through a tough time right now due to this pandemic but everyone&rsquo;s still doing there fair share of help to make the situation better So i also decided to help and developing this project was a very adventrous undertaking i love problem solving and tinkering with code so its been fun and i learned a lot through it.</p>

<p><u>
<b>PROBLEMS I AM TRYING TO SOLVE:-</b>
</u></p>

<p> Omg we all have experienced it very well when there&rsquo;s a quiz notification posted on our whatsapp group and we missed because either our internet was closed or there&rsquo;s been a thousand messages in our group and we are too lazy to read through them to find the important one. So, i decided why not create a web app where teachers cam post all the important notifications and when they post it will remain on the home page buy they will also be sent as a message to all the students.</p>

<p><u>
<b>TECHNOLOGIES I HAVE USED:-</b>
</u></p>

<p><u>FRONT END:-</u></p>

<p> HTML</p>

<p> CSS</p>

<p> JAVASCRIPT</p>

<p> BOOTSTRAP</p>

<p><u>BACKEND:-</u></p>

<p> PYTHON</p>

<p> DJANGO FRAMEWORK</p>

<p> SQLITE as my database engine</p>

<p><u>
<b>FUTURE VIEW:-</b>
